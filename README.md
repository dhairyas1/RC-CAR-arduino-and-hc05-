This program runs an rc car using a Bluetooth module (HC-05), Arduino UNO, and an app made using mit app inventor.

The app's joystick's range is from x (60 to 220) and y (220 to 60). Data is sent from the app as x:y (wherein x is the x coordinate and y is the y coordinate); each new set of coordinates is separated by a new line.
